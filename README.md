Streamlit Examples
===

Streamlit is a faster way to build and share data apps. Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. All in pure Python. No frontâ€‘end experience required. 

This repo contains series of example Python code provides you a step-by-step progress to learn to use Streamlit to build your application. 

## Prequesites
1. You know how to set a Python environment, you can use virtualenv(aka venv), pyenv, or conda to create it.
2. Start from #3 example, it will use LLM(Large Language Model) from Amazon Bedrock. Please make sure you enabled models from Amazon Bedrock. Recommend to use `us-east-1` region.
3. You have AWS profile/credentials setup. In some example, I will use a profile in my local called `us-east-1`. You can use your preferred profile name and simply change it. Or use the `dotenv` to setup.

## Setup
Assume you have Python environment setup.
1. Install Python libraries
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Prepare your AWS credentials / Profile
```
cp env-example .env
```
modify the `.env` accordingly to make sure you have necessary permissions.

## Run
You can run the code one by one, each one is an independent Streamlit app.
```
streamlit run xxx.py  
```
